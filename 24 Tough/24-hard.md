24. Create a docker image of simple login form using django on port 6000.

Note: Port 6000 may be blocked on some browsers, because of which this may not work on port 6000. Instead just use another port like 5000.

Create a new directory:  
**mkdir simple_django_app**  
**cd simple_django_app**

Paste all files from zip folder into this directory.  
django_app/  
│  
├── Dockerfile                 \# Dockerfile to containerize the app  
├── requirements.txt           \# List of Python dependencies (Django)  
├── manage.py                  \# Django project management file  
├── myproject/                 \# Django project folder (generated by Django)  
│  
├── myapp/                     \# Django app folder (generated by \`startapp\`)  
│  
├── myapp/templates/           \# Template folder for HTML files  
│   ├── login.html             \# Login form  
│   └── success.html           \# Login success page  
│  
└── requirements.txt   

Build the docker image:  
**docker build -t django_app .**  
Execute **docker images** to verify whether the image was created.

Run it using:  
**docker run -p 5000:5000 django_app**

Go to [**http://localhost:5000/login**] to view your Django app.

For login, enter any credentials. It will route you to success page.

**Note: Make sure port 5000 is not being used by another application. Else, try another port.**
